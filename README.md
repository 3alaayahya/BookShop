âœ¨ Key Features:
Physical Book Trading
Physical books are unique and can be owned by one person at a time. If a user wants to purchase a physical book, they can send a request to the current owner. Upon acceptance, the book is automatically transferred to the buyer's My Books library.

Online Book Support
Online books are available directly for purchase and reading without the need for owner-to-owner transactions.
